### 5. 🛒 **E-Commerce Integration**

Even if you use Shopify under the hood:

* Avoid obvious store templates
* Remove typical “collections” grid view
* Treat products as **hero stories**, not SKU cards
* Use scroll or swipe interaction to view product specs

### 6. 📷 **Photography & Video**

| Style        | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Studio       | High contrast black/white with hard shadows    |
| Lifestyle    | Natural lighting, training or recovery context |
| Text Overlay | Use animated captions, not static blocks       |

### 7. 🗣️ **Voice & Copy**

* Short, punchy sentences.
* Use active tone: *“Push harder. Lift smarter. Move better.”*
* Avoid cliché fitness terms: "Beast mode", "no pain no gain", etc.
* Highlight **capability** and **consistency** — not ego.
